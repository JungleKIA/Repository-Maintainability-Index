refactor(docs): consolidate security documentation and test LLM key

Based on feedback:
- Remove Russian documentation files (keep English only)
- Remove redundant status/test report files
- Add LLM API key testing script for quick verification
- Create consolidated status documentation

Changes:
- Deleted 9 redundant documentation files with exposed/redacted keys
- Deleted 2 Russian documentation files
- Added test_llm_key.sh for quick API key validation
- Added LLM_API_KEY_STATUS.md with current key status
- Added SECURITY_AND_STATUS.md as consolidated reference
- Added TESTING_NOTES.md with testing procedures

Testing:
- Tested new API key: sk-or-v1-19b02376...76ac436754
- Result: Valid key, but requires $5 credit purchase
- Error: 402 - Insufficient credits
- Application works with fallback LLM mode

Status:
- Security: All leaked keys previously removed ✅
- Documentation: Consolidated to essential files ✅  
- API Key: Valid but needs credits ⚠️
- Application: Fully functional ✅

Next step: Purchase credits at https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits
