# CI/CD Pipeline for Repository Maintainability Index
# 
# Improvements implemented:
# ✅ Explicit code coverage threshold check (jacoco:check)
# ✅ SpotBugs now blocks build on critical bugs (removed continue-on-error)
# ✅ Optimized: Reuse compiled classes across jobs (no duplicate compilation)
# ✅ Added OWASP Dependency Check for security vulnerabilities
# ✅ Added Trivy DB caching for faster scans
# ✅ Added automatic GitHub Release creation on version tags
# ✅ Package job now depends on code-quality and security-scan
# 
# Required GitHub Branch Protection Rules:
# - Require status checks: build-and-test, code-quality, security-scan
# - Require branches to be up to date before merging
